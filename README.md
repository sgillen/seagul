# seagul
A utility library. I collected most of the software I use for my resarch and put it here. 

This is a python package, after cloning I recommend you install it (in some sort of virtual environment) with:

```
pip install -e seagul/
```
 
You can install all the requirments with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
